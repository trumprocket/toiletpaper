# The Toilet Paper/Brown Paper

* like litecoin
* uses scrypt PoW
* scrypt PoW sounds cool
* lasts multiple thousands of years
* smallest units are called Trumpettes
* [made using a hand-holding altcoin coin generator i found on duckduckgo](https://github.com/saivnct/altcoin-generator)
* abbreviation will be **TRUMP** because *of course it will be.*
* ***not a token, an actual coin***
* **all addresses** will start with **"T"** as in **Trump**
* no static nodes means complete decentralization
* i hate walletbuilders, they can go to hell
* no compiled builds, build from source you can verify and not trust (plus we're too lazy lol)
